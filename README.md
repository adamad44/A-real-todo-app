# A Real Todo App

A todo app that actually helps you manage your time, not just track tasks.

## What Makes It Different

Instead of binary "done" or "not done" checkboxes, this todo app uses **progress sliders** to help you realistically manage your tasks and time. Track how much work you've put into each task and see your actual progress.

## Why Progress Matters

Most todo apps treat tasks as simple on/off switches. Real work doesn't happen that way. You start tasks, make progress, get interrupted, and continue later. This app acknowledges that reality by letting you track partial completion and see exactly how much effort you've invested in each task.

Built with vanilla JavaScript, Bootstrap 5, and HTML5 localStorage. FOR NOW.
